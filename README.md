VICE, the Virtual Integrated Circuit Engine. 

I originally wrote VICE for the first [Olympiad of Misguided Geeks Worse Than Failure, or 
OMGWTF contest](http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Worse-Than-Failure-Programming-Contest.aspx), and made it into the top 12. Because I am now intending to enter the [OMGWTF 2 contest](http://omg2.thedailywtf.com/), I thought I'd share the original.
